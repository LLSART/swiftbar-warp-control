fix: properly establish WARP connection to fix DNS and disconnection issues

## Critical Bug Fixes
- Fix "macOS WARP DNS servers are not being set" CRITICAL error
- Fix "Frequent Disconnections" CRITICAL error  
- Properly establish VPN connection, not just start daemon process

## Changes

### scripts/warp-control.sh
- Enhanced `start_warp()`: Now calls `warp-cli connect` after launching daemon
- Enhanced `stop_warp()`: Now calls `warp-cli disconnect` before unloading daemon
- Enhanced `get_status()`: Shows detailed connection status and WARP settings

### Technical Details

**Root Cause:**
Previous version only used `launchctl load/unload` which started the daemon 
process but didn't establish the actual VPN connection. This caused:
- DNS servers not being configured
- Network routes not being set up
- Firewall rules not being applied
- VPN tunnel not being established

**Solution:**
Now properly integrates with WARP using official `warp-cli` commands:
1. Start: `launchctl load` → `warp-cli connect` 
2. Stop: `warp-cli disconnect` → `launchctl unload`

This ensures DNS configuration, routing, and all network features work correctly.

## Documentation Added
- WARP_FIX.md: Detailed technical explanation
- QUICK_UPDATE.md: Quick update guide for users
- EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md: Problem diagnosis and solution summary
- test-fix.sh: Automated test script to verify the fix
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with v1.1.0 release notes

## Migration for Users

Users experiencing DNS or connection issues should update:

```bash
sudo cp scripts/warp-control.sh /usr/local/bin/warp-control.sh
sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/warp-control.sh
```

## Testing

Verify the fix:
```bash
sudo /usr/local/bin/warp-control.sh start
warp-cli status  # Should show "Connected"
scutil --dns | grep nameserver  # Should show Cloudflare DNS
```

Or run automated test:
```bash
bash test-fix.sh
```

## Impact
- Severity: HIGH (fixes CRITICAL level issues)
- Affected Users: All users, especially those with DNS/connection problems
- Breaking Changes: None
- Backwards Compatible: Yes
