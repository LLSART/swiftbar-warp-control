# SwiftBar WARP Control

**üö® SOLVES: Cloudflare WARP stuck on/force-enabled - can't turn off issue**

**Professional macOS menu bar tool for password-free Cloudflare WARP VPN control**

A secure and efficient SwiftBar plugin that provides seamless Cloudflare WARP VPN management directly from your macOS menu bar. **Specifically designed to solve the common problem where Cloudflare WARP gets stuck in force-enabled mode and cannot be turned off through the normal interface.**

üîß **Core Problem Solved**: When Cloudflare WARP enters a forced-on state and becomes unresponsive to disable commands through the GUI, this tool provides reliable command-line based control to force disconnect and regain control of your VPN connection.

## When You Need This Tool

### üÜò Common WARP Problems This Solves:
- ‚ùå "WARP won't turn off" - when the toggle is grayed out
- ‚ùå "WARP stuck on" - when disconnecting doesn't work  
- ‚ùå "Can't disable WARP" - when GUI controls become unresponsive
- ‚ùå "WARP force enabled" - when enterprise/managed policies keep it on
- ‚ùå "WARP app frozen" - when the official app stops responding

### ‚úÖ Why This Tool Works:
- **Direct CLI Control**: Bypasses GUI limitations using `warp-cli` commands
- **Force Disconnect**: Can terminate WARP connections that GUI can't stop
- **Administrative Override**: Uses elevated privileges to ensure control works
- **Process Management**: Can kill and restart WARP daemon if needed

## Requirements

- **macOS**: 10.15 (Catalina) or later
- **Cloudflare WARP**: Must be installed from App Store or official website
- **Admin Access**: Required for initial setup only

## Installation

Run this single command in Terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leeguooooo/swiftbar-warp-control/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or clone and install manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leeguooooo/swiftbar-warp-control.git
cd swiftbar-warp-control
bash install.sh
```

## What Gets Installed

The installer automatically handles:

1. **Homebrew** (if not already installed)
2. **SwiftBar** (if not already installed)
3. **WARP Control Script** (`/usr/local/bin/warp-control.sh`)
4. **Sudo Configuration** (`/etc/sudoers.d/warp-toggle`)
5. **SwiftBar Plugin** (`~/swiftbar/warp.5s.sh`)
6. **SwiftBar Configuration** (automatic plugin directory setup)

## Security

This tool is designed with security in mind:

- **Minimal Privileges**: Only allows password-free execution of the specific WARP control script
- **User-Specific**: Permissions are granted only to the installing user
- **Isolated Commands**: No access to other system commands or sudo operations
- **Open Source**: Full code transparency for security review

The sudo configuration only allows:
```bash
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/warp-control.sh
```

## Usage

After installation, the WARP control icon will automatically appear in your menu bar. **No manual configuration required** - the installer automatically sets up SwiftBar with the correct plugin directory.

### Status Indicators
- **üü¢ WARP**: Connected and running
- **üî¥ WARP**: Disconnected or stopped

### Menu Actions
- **Start WARP**: Connect to Cloudflare WARP
- **Stop WARP**: Disconnect from WARP
- **Restart WARP**: Restart the WARP connection
- **View Status**: See detailed connection status in terminal
- **Open WARP App**: Launch the official WARP application

### Command Line Usage

You can also control WARP directly from the terminal:

```bash
# Start WARP
sudo /usr/local/bin/warp-control.sh start

# Stop WARP
sudo /usr/local/bin/warp-control.sh stop

# Check status
sudo /usr/local/bin/warp-control.sh status

# Toggle on/off
sudo /usr/local/bin/warp-control.sh toggle
```

## Uninstall

To completely remove all components:

```bash
bash uninstall.sh
```

This will remove:
- WARP control script
- Sudo configuration
- SwiftBar plugin

*Note: SwiftBar and Cloudflare WARP applications are not automatically removed.*

## Manual Uninstall

If you need to manually remove components:

```bash
# Remove WARP control script
sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/warp-control.sh

# Remove sudo configuration
sudo rm -f /etc/sudoers.d/warp-toggle

# Remove SwiftBar plugin
rm -f ~/swiftbar/warp.5s.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

### WARP doesn't start/stop
1. Ensure Cloudflare WARP is installed and working
2. Try running the control script manually:
   ```bash
   sudo /usr/local/bin/warp-control.sh status
   ```

### Menu bar icon doesn't appear
1. Check if SwiftBar is running
2. Restart SwiftBar application
3. If still not working, manually verify plugin directory in SwiftBar preferences (should be `~/swiftbar`)
4. Refresh SwiftBar plugins

### Permission denied errors
1. Verify sudoers configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo visudo -c -f /etc/sudoers.d/warp-toggle
   ```
2. Try logging out and back in
3. Reinstall using the install script

### SwiftBar plugin shows error
1. Check if the control script exists:
   ```bash
   ls -la /usr/local/bin/warp-control.sh
   ```
2. Verify script permissions:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/warp-control.sh
   ```
