# Fix Cloudflare WARP Stuck On/Force Enabled Issue

**üö® SOLVES: WARP Won't Turn Off, Stuck On, Force-Enabled Problems**

**Professional macOS menu bar tool for reliable Cloudflare WARP control**

When Cloudflare WARP gets **stuck in force-enabled mode** and won't turn off through the normal interface, this tool provides **reliable command-line based control** to force disconnect and regain control of your VPN connection. Specifically designed for the common problem where WARP becomes unresponsive to GUI controls.

## üÜò Common WARP Problems This Solves

### When WARP Gets Stuck:
- ‚ùå **"WARP won't turn off"** - Toggle is grayed out or unresponsive
- ‚ùå **"WARP stuck on"** - Disconnect button doesn't work
- ‚ùå **"Can't disable WARP"** - GUI controls become frozen
- ‚ùå **"WARP force enabled"** - Enterprise policies prevent disconnection
- ‚ùå **"WARP app frozen"** - Official app stops responding

### ‚úÖ Why Our Solution Works:
- **Direct CLI Control**: Bypasses GUI limitations using reliable `warp-cli` commands
- **Force Disconnect**: Can terminate WARP connections that GUI can't stop
- **Administrative Override**: Uses elevated privileges to ensure control works
- **Process Management**: Can kill and restart WARP daemon if needed
